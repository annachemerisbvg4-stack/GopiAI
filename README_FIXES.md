# GopiAI Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to the GopiAI repository.

## 1. Browser Tools Disabled

- **File:** `GopiAI-CrewAI/tools/gopiai_integration/browser_tools.py`
- **Change:** The entire content of the file was commented out to disable the non-functional browser tools.

- **File:** `GopiAI-CrewAI/tools/gopiai_integration/tool_aliases.py`
- **Change:** The aliases for the browser tools were commented out to prevent them from being loaded.

## 2. Filesystem Tools Fixed

- **File:** `GopiAI-CrewAI/tools/gopiai_integration/filesystem_tools.py`
- **Change:** The tool name was corrected from `gopiai_filesystem` to `filesystem_tools` to match its intended name.

- **File:** `GopiAI-CrewAI/tools/gopiai_integration/crewai_tools_integrator.py`
- **Change:** Explicit registration for `filesystem_tools` was added to ensure the tool is loaded correctly.

## 3. AIRouterLLM Initialization Fixed

- **File:** `GopiAI-UI/gopiai/ui/components/crewai_client.py`
- **Change:** The `AIRouterLLM` constructor is now correctly called with the `model_config_manager` instance to prevent initialization errors.

## 4. Agent Hallucination Prevented

- **File:** `GopiAI-CrewAI/tools/gopiai_integration/system_prompts.py`
- **Change:** A new `CustomCrewAIAgent` class was added. This class includes a system prompt that forces the agent to use existing tools instead of "hallucinating" or inventing tool outputs. This is intended to improve the reliability of the AI's tool usage.
