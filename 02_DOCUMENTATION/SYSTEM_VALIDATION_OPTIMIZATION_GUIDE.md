validator = SystemValidator()

# Run validation
validation_result = validator.validate_system_on_real_data()

# Run optimization
optimization_result = validator.optimize_execution_times()

# Configure load balancing
load_balancing_config = validator.configure_load_balancing()

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks various performance metrics:

### Test Execution Metrics
- Test execution time
- Test success rate
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Parallel efficiency
- Worker utilization
- Queue wait time
- Resource contention
- Error rates
- Retry counts

### System Performance Metrics
- Total execution time
- Overall success rate
- Resource utilization
- Parallel efficiency
- Bottleneck identification
- Performance score (0-100)

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Pytest Configuration Optimization
- Adds performance-oriented command line options
- Configures test markers for categorization
- Enables strict marker checking
- Reduces verbose output

### 2. Test Caching
- Implements result caching to avoid re-running unchanged tests
- Uses file hashes and dependency analysis for cache invalidation
- Configurable cache duration and invalidation triggers

### 3. Test Ordering Optimization
- Orders tests by historical execution time (fast tests first)
- Creates parallel test groups based on execution characteristics
- Optimizes dependency-based execution ordering

### 4. Smart Test Selection
- Selects tests based on code changes
- Uses dependency analysis to determine affected tests
- Implements risk assessment for test prioritization
- Maintains minimum test coverage requirements

### 5. Resource Usage Optimization
- Optimizes memory usage with garbage collection tuning
- Configures CPU affinity and process priority
- Implements I/O optimization with buffering and cleanup

## Load Balancing Configuration

### Worker Count Calculation
The system calculates optimal worker count based on:
- Available CPU cores (CPU count - 1)
- Available memory (assuming 512MB per worker)
- System load and resource constraints
- Maximum limit of 8 workers to prevent resource exhaustion

### Distribution Strategies
- **Environment-based**: Distributes tests by virtual environment
- **Category-based**: Distributes tests by test category
- **Round-robin**: Evenly distributes tests across workers

### Parallel Groups
- **Unit Tests**: High parallelism (up to 4 workers)
- **Integration Tests**: Limited parallelism (up to 2 workers)
- **UI Tests**: Sequential execution (1 worker)
- **E2E Tests**: Sequential with service coordination

## Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- Continuous system resource monitoring
- Test execution metrics collection
- Performance threshold monitoring
- Automatic alerting on threshold violations

### Historical Tracking
- 90-day retention of performance data
- Hourly, daily, and weekly aggregation
- Trend analysis with degradation detection
- Performance comparison over time

### Alerting Rules
- **Slow Test Execution**: execution_time > 300 seconds
- **High Failure Rate**: success_rate < 80%
- **Memory Exhaustion**: memory_usage > 80%
- **CPU Overload**: cpu_usage > 90%

### Dashboard Components
- Test execution overview
- Resource usage timeseries
- Parallel performance gauges
- Performance trend analysis

## Performance Thresholds

Default performance thresholds:
- Maximum execution time: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
- Minimum success rate: 85%
- Maximum memory usage: 80%
- Maximum CPU usage: 85%
- Minimum parallel efficiency: 60%
- Maximum retry rate: 10%

## Integration with Existing System

The system validation and optimization integrates with:
- **Master Test Runner**: Uses for test execution
- **Test Discovery**: Uses for finding tests
- **Performance Monitor**: Uses for detailed monitoring
- **Service Manager**: Uses for service coordination
- **Quality Tracker**: Uses for quality metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Environment Not Found
**Problem**: Virtual environment directories not found
**Solution**: Ensure virtual environments are properly set up in expected locations

#### 2. Service Manager Not Available
**Problem**: ServiceManager import fails
**Solution**: System gracefully degrades to mock service manager

#### 3. Insufficient Resources
**Problem**: System runs out of memory or CPU during parallel execution
**Solution**: System automatically reduces worker count based on available resources

#### 4. Test Discovery Fails
**Problem**: No tests discovered or invalid test modules
**Solution**: Check test directory structure and naming conventions

### Performance Issues

#### 1. Slow Validation
**Problem**: System validation takes too long
**Solution**: 
- Reduce test scope for validation
- Increase parallel workers if resources allow
- Use test caching to skip unchanged tests

#### 2. High Resource Usage
**Problem**: System uses too much memory or CPU
**Solution**:
- Reduce parallel worker count
- Enable resource optimization settings
- Monitor and adjust resource allocation

#### 3. Poor Parallel Efficiency
**Problem**: Parallel execution not providing expected speedup
**Solution**:
- Review test dependencies and grouping
- Optimize test ordering
- Check for resource contention

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Validation
- Run system validation weekly or after major changes
- Monitor performance trends over time
- Address bottlenecks and optimization recommendations promptly

### 2. Resource Management
- Monitor system resources during test execution
- Adjust worker count based on available resources
- Use resource optimization settings for constrained environments

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Set up continuous performance monitoring
- Configure appropriate alerting thresholds
- Review performance reports regularly

### 4. Optimization Maintenance
- Re-run optimization after significant code changes
- Update test ordering based on new performance data
- Maintain test caching configuration
