# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on systematically analyzing and cleaning up the GopiAI project codebase to improve maintainability, remove dead code, eliminate duplicates, and ensure proper project organization. The cleanup process will follow a structured approach of analysis, identification of issues, and reporting without making immediate code changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze the overall project structure, so that I can understand the current organization and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis starts THEN the system SHALL examine all directories and files in the project root
2. WHEN examining the structure THEN the system SHALL identify the purpose of each major component and module
3. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL document the relationships between GopiAI-* modules
4. WHEN reviewing organization THEN the system SHALL assess whether the current structure follows the established patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze the codebase quality and consistency, so that I can identify areas that need improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL review key files and modules for coding style consistency
2. WHEN examining code THEN the system SHALL identify complex or confusing code sections
3. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL assess the quality and completeness of comments
4. WHEN checking standards THEN the system SHALL verify adherence to Python coding conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify dead and unused code, so that I can remove unnecessary components and improve maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for dead code THEN the system SHALL identify unused functions, classes, and variables
2. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the system SHALL find unused import statements
3. WHEN reviewing comments THEN the system SHALL identify commented-out code blocks that are no longer relevant
4. WHEN checking references THEN the system SHALL verify that all defined components are actually used

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to find outdated and temporary files, so that I can clean up the project workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning directories THEN the system SHALL identify temporary files and backup copies
2. WHEN analyzing file patterns THEN the system SHALL find files that don't match current project structure
3. WHEN checking timestamps THEN the system SHALL identify potentially outdated files
4. WHEN reviewing file types THEN the system SHALL flag non-standard or suspicious file extensions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze project dependencies, so that I can ensure they are current and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify all external libraries and frameworks
2. WHEN checking versions THEN the system SHALL compare current versions with latest available versions
3. WHEN assessing security THEN the system SHALL identify potentially vulnerable or outdated dependencies
4. WHEN reviewing requirements THEN the system SHALL check for unused or redundant dependencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify duplicate code, so that I can refactor it into reusable components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for duplicates THEN the system SHALL find similar code blocks across different files
2. WHEN analyzing functions THEN the system SHALL identify repeated logic that could be extracted
3. WHEN reviewing patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest opportunities for creating shared utilities
4. WHEN checking modules THEN the system SHALL find duplicate functionality across GopiAI-* components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify potential conflicts and errors, so that I can prevent runtime issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL identify potential race conditions and threading issues
2. WHEN checking resource usage THEN the system SHALL find potential memory leaks or resource conflicts
3. WHEN reviewing error handling THEN the system SHALL identify unhandled exceptions
4. WHEN examining global state THEN the system SHALL flag potentially problematic global variables

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to assess documentation quality, so that I can ensure the project is properly documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL check for completeness and accuracy
2. WHEN analyzing README files THEN the system SHALL verify they reflect current project state
3. WHEN examining code comments THEN the system SHALL identify areas needing better documentation
4. WHEN checking API docs THEN the system SHALL ensure all public interfaces are documented

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive a comprehensive cleanup report, so that I can prioritize and plan improvement tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report of all findings
2. WHEN presenting issues THEN the system SHALL group problems by category and severity
3. WHEN describing problems THEN the system SHALL include file locations and line numbers where applicable
4. WHEN suggesting solutions THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations without implementing them
5. WHEN prioritizing issues THEN the system SHALL rank problems by impact and effort required
